# Fixing Gradient Feedback in MyWhoosh
https://stefaandesmet2003.github.io/hometrainer/mywhooshsetup.html

Currently resistance control / gradient feedback doesn't seem to work in the MyWhoosh app on a number of older indoor trainers, including Elite Direto, when connected over BLE.

Until MyWhoosh has the issue fixed, going through this simple setup will get you going. The fix sends the 'Start' command to the indoor trainer that's missing during pairing in Mywhoosh. Obviously this needs to be done after each power on of your indoor trainer.

This fix has been tested on Elite Direto, but may work on other trainer types as well. Feel free to let me know how you go.

# fitness test
https://stefaandesmet2003.github.io/hometrainer/fitnesstest.html

The fitness test starts with a gentle 5 minutes, before activating the trainer's ERG mode.  
The target power level starts at 100 watts, and increases by 20 watts every 2 minutes.

No matter what gear your bike is in, the ERG mode will make you suffer.  
The test works in any but the lowest gears, in ERG mode the trainer adjusts the resistance automatically.  
It helps to use a rather high gear, to make the trainer's flywheel spin fast and provide some extra inertia.
 
# pedalling analysis
https://stefaandesmet2003.github.io/hometrainer/pedallingAnalysis.html

This page shows how smoothly you are pedalling.  
It is basically the same as the Elite 'myEtraining' paying feature, but then for free.  
Direto has only 12 measuring points per pedal revolution, Drivo is supposed to have 24.  
Hit Connect, wait until the page says 'Connected', and start pedalling. If you prefer some harder work, there are 10 resistance levels to chose from.<br>

**With or without cadence sensor?**  
Pedalling analysis works without an additional cadence sensor.<br>

But Direto has a 2.5mm jack above the power connection for hooking up a cadence sensor. Any reed contact + magnet combination will work, for instance some spares from an old wired bike computer. The 2.5mm jack can be easily sourced on ebay.

The cadence sensor provides an accurate reference for every pedal revolution. With that reference the pedal analysis will show accurate angles, and correctly distinguish between left and right foot.
